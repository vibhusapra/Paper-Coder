# Paper Coder
 Writes code to test an arxiv paper

# Outline
1. Ingest paper and provide a summary
2. Outline the experiments of the paper in depth
3. Pass along the experiments section of the paper toa model to generate the directory structure of the code in a paper
4. For each describe each file and it's function
5. Generate the code for each file


# Improvments
1. Scrape more docs and do RAG for more relevant research
2. Parallel calls
3. For code structure generation - send in full text, not just experiemnts section
4. Use proper fn calls
5. Attach it to the web and let it properly run the experiments and compare the results
6. Better prompting
7. Better file structure generation
